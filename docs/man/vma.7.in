.SH NAME
VMA \- NVIDIA Messaging Accelerator (VMA) library.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B libvma.so

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B VMA
NVIDIA Messaging Accelerator (VMA) boosts performance for message-based
and streaming applications such as those found in financial services market
data environments and Web2.0 clusters. It allows application written over
standard socket API to run over Ethernet and/or Infiniband from user-space
with full network stack bypass. The result is a reduction in latency by as
much as 300%, an increase in application throughput by as much as 200%, higher
packets rates and better CPU utilization as compared to applications running
on standard Ethernet or InfiniBand interconnect networks.
