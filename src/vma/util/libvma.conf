# libvma.conf - configuration file for libvma

#
# Comments are starts with # and cause the entire line after it to be ignored.
# Any beginning whitespace is skipped. Any line that is empty is also skipped.
#
# There are 3 main types of statements supported by this configuration file:
# - application-id - which specifies the proccess to whom all the 
#   statments  which appear between it and the next "application-id" statment 
#   (if any) are apllied to.
# - "use"    - which defines the transport to be used for the sockets that
#	       match the line.
# - "log"    - for setting logging related configuration. As the log settings 
#   takes immidiate effect we define these straight after the "application-id".
#
##############################################################################
# DEAFUALT SETTINGS:
# Please do not forget to comment if you want to change these.
# (the rest of this file explains the syntax and give examples)
#

#
# By default apply the statments to any application with any ID
application-id * *

#
# SPECIFICATION OF THE TARGET PROCCESS
# ------------------------------
# The target proccess statment specify the proccess which has to follow the
# control statments which appear below this directive and till the next
# target proccess statment.
# Each statement specifies a matching rule that all its
# subexpressions must evaluate as true (logical and) to apply.
#
# The format of this statment is :
# application-id <program-name|*> <user-defined-id| *>
#
# <program-name|*> field:
#  Defines the program name (not including the path) the statments, which
#  appears below that directive, apply to.
#  Wildcards with same semantics as "ls" are supported (* and ?).
#  So db2* would match on any program with a name starting with db2.
#  t?cp would match on ttcp, etc.
#  If not provided (default) the statement matches all programs.
#
#<user-defined-id|*> field:
#  Specify the proccess ID the statments which appears below that directive,
#  apply to. 
#  In order to configure user-defined-id besides specifying it in
#  configuration files, also needed to set the
#  VMA_APPLICATION_ID environment variable to the same value which
#  appears in user-defined-id filed of the application-id statment.
#

#
# LOG CONFIGURATION: NOT FULLY SUPPORTED YET !
# ------------------
# The log directive allows the user to specify which and where debug and error
# messages get sent. The log statement format is:
# log [destination stderr|syslog|file <filename>] [min-level <1-9>]
# 
# destination - defines the destination of the log messages:
#   stderr - messages will be forwarded to the stderr 
#   syslog - messages sent to the syslog service
#   file <filename> - messages will be written to the file /var/log/<filename> for root.
#   		      for regular user, if full path is requsted <filename with path>.<uid>
#   		      or /tmp/<filename>.<uid> if no path is requested 
#
# min-level - defines the verbosity of the log: 
# 9 - only errors are printed
# 8 - warnings
# 7 - connect and listen summary (useful for tracking SDP usage)
# 4 - positive match summary (useful for config file debug)
# 3 - negative match summary (useful for config file debug)
# 2 - function calls and return values
# 1 - debug messages

#
# SOCKET TRANSPORT CONTROL:
# ------------------------------
# The socket control statements allows the user to specify when libvma will
# offload AF_INET/SOCK_STREAM or AF_INET/SOCK_DATAGRAM sockets.
# Each control statement specifies a matching rule that all its
# subexpressions must evaluate as true (logical and) to apply. 
#
# The statements that control which type transport to use are made
# of the following:
# use <transport> <role> <address|*>:<port range|*>[:<address|*>:<port range|*>]
# 
# <transport> can be one of:
#  "vma" - for specifying when VMA should be used.
#  "os"  - for specifying when socket should handled by os network stack.
# 
# <role> can be one of:
#  1. "tcp_server".
#  2. "tcp_client"
#  3. "udp_sender"
#  4. "udp_receiver"
#  5. "udp_connect"
#
# <address|*> means:
#  Either the local address the server is bind to or the remote server
#  address the client connects to. Syntax for address matching is:
# <IPv4 address>[/<prefix_length>]|*
#   IPv4 address = [0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+ each sub number < 255
#   prefix_length = [0-9]+ and with value <= 32. A prefix_length of 24
#   matches the subnet mask 255.255.255.0 . A prefix_length of 32
#   requires matching of the exact IP.
#
# <port range> is:
# start-port[-end-port] where port numbers are >0 and < 65536
# 
# Rules are evaluated in order of definition. So the first match wins.
# If no match is made vma will default to "vma".
#
# Detailed explanation:
#
# udp_receiver - local_ip:local_port
# udp_sender - remote_ip:remote_port
# udp_connect - remote_ip:remote_port:local_ip:local_port
# tcp_server - local_ip:local_port
# tcp_client - remote_ip:remote_port:local_ip:local_port
#
# For TCP, the socket must be either all (recv & send / listen) offloaded or all not offloaded.
# For UDP, the recv and send from/to each address are independent, and can be separately defined as offloaded or not.
#
# For TCP connected socket - use tcp_client with 5 tuple specification starting from remote and ending with local address.
# For TCP listen socket - use tcp_server with the local address to listen on.
# For TCP accepted sockets - offloading is determined by the listen socket it was accepted through. 
# If the listen socket is offloaded, all accepted sockets are offloaded and if it is not offloaded, all accepted sockets are not offloaded.
# Therefore, no special rule is available for accepted sockets.
#
# For UDP receive - use udp_receiver with local address. For MC, use MC ip and port.
# For UDP send - use udp_sender with remote address. For MC, use MC ip and port.
# For UDP connect - use 5 tuple specification starting from remote and ending with local address.
# UDP connect rule will only affect UDP sockets which connect() have been called on.
# A "use os udp_connect" rule will pass the socket to be handled exclusively by OS (no more offloaded traffic).
# A "use vma udp_connect" rule still leave the socket to be impacted by udp_sender and udp_receiver rules (which makes it practically useless).

#
# Examples:
#-------------------------------
# Apply the rules to program tcp_lat with ID B1, also don't forget to set 
# the VMA_APPLICATION_ID: export VMA_APPLICATION_ID=B1
#		 application  	user defined id 
# application-id tcp_lat	B1
#
# Use VMA by TCP clients on any local interface connecting to machines that belongs to subnet 192.168.1.*
#     transport role       address:port[-range]
# use vma       tcp_client 192.168.1.0/24:*:*:*
#
# Use OS by when TCP server listens to port 5001 of any machine
#     family role         address:port[-range]
# use os     tcp_server   *:5001
