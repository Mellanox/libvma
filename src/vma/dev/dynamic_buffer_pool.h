 * A buffer pool with option to dynamically grow when a minimal threshold of free buffers is left.

 * The user provides a callback to be called once the minimum free buffers threshold is reached and accordingly to decide what context and when to allocate additional buffers.
 * The calls to get_buffers is never blocked on waiting for new buffers but returns with failure in case of lack of buffers.
