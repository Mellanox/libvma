.SH NAME
vma_get_api

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <mellanox/vma_extra.h>
.sp
.BI "struct vma_api_t* vma_get_api()";

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B vma_get_api()
Return a pointer to VMA API functions.
.sp
Use the vma_get_api() function to check if VMA is loaded in your
application, and if the VMA Extra API is accessible.
If the function returns with NULL, either VMA is not loaded with the application,
or the VMA Extra API is not compatible with the header function used for compiling
your application. NULL will be the typical return value when running the application
on native OS without VMA loaded.
Any non-NULL return value is a vma_api_t type structure pointer that holds pointers
to the specific VMA Extra API function calls which are needed for the application to use.
It is recommended to call vma_get_api() once on startup, and to use the returned
pointer throughout the life of the process.
There is no need to release this pointer in any way.

.SH RETURN_VALUE
.B On success, a pointer on VMA API functions. On error, NULL pointer.

.SH ERRORS
.B Undefined.
