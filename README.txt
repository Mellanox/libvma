Introduction
============

Mellanox's Messaging Accelerator (VMA) is dynamically linked user space Linux
library for transparently enhancing the performance of networking-heavy
applications. It boosts performance for message-based and streaming applications
such as those found in financial services market data environments and Web2.0
clusters.
It allows application written over standard socket API to run over Infiniband 
and/or Ethernet from user-space with full network stack bypass.
The result is a reduction in latency by as much as 300%, 
an increase in application throughput by as much as 200%,
higher packets rates and better CPU utilization as compared to applications
running on standard Ethernet or InfiniBand interconnect networks.

Build libvma from source
========================

Prerequisites:
1. MLNX_OFED as described in the "Pre Installation" step of next section.
2. Or, upstream kernel and userspace verbs libraries (libibverbs, libmlx4, librdmacm)
3. Autoconf, Automake, libtool, unzip, patch, libnl-devel (netlink 1 or 3)

Build:
1. ./autogen.sh
2. ./configure --with-ofed=/usr --prefix=/usr --libdir=/usr/lib64 --includedir=/usr/include/mellanox --docdir=/usr/share/doc/libvma --sysconfdir=/etc
3. make

You will find libvma.so in path_to_vma_dir/src/vma/.libs/libvma.so.

Install:
1. sudo make install

Tip:
./install.sh can do the build and install steps for you.


Install libvma from rpm or debian
=================================

Pre Installation:
1. If possible, install latest MLNX_OFED with the --vma option.
   This will also install libvma, and you can skip to "Running" step.
2. If installing over existing MLNX_OFED, add the following to
   /etc/modprobe.d/mlnx.conf:
   options ib_uverbs disable_raw_qp_enforcement=1
   options mlx4_core fast_drop=1
   options mlx4_core log_num_mgm_entry_size=-1
   And restart the driver: /etc/init.d/openibd restart

Installing:
Install the package as any other rpm or debian package [rpm -i libvma.X.Y.Z-R.rpm].
The installation copies the VMA library to: /usr/lib[64]/libvma.so
The VMA monitoring utility is installed at: /usr/bin/vma_stat
The VMA extra socket API is located at: /usr/include/mellanox/vma_extra.h
The installation location of the README.txt and version information file 
(VMA_VERSION), are as follows:
- Redhat: /usr/share/doc/libvma-X.Y.Z-R/
- SuSE:   /usr/share/doc/packages/libvma-X.Y.Z-R/

Post Installation:
When working over Infiniband, we recommend to manually add persistence
for the following system parameters:
1. Force IPoIB to work in 'datagram' mode (disabling IPoIB 'connected' mode)
   Modify "SET_IPOIB_CM=no" in file "/etc/infiniband/openib.conf"
2. Force IGMP to work in V2 on IB interfaces
   Add "net.ipv4.conf.all.force_igmp_version = 2" in file "/etc/sysctl.conf" 

Upgrading:
Use rpm update procedure: # rpm -U libvma.X.Y.Z-R.rpm
You can upgrade by uninstalling (rpm -e) the previously installed package
before starting to install the new VMA rpm.

Uninstalling:
When uninstalling remember to uninstall (rpm -e) the package before you 
uninstall ofed.

Running:
Set the env variable LD_PRELOAD to libvma.so and run your application.
Example: # LD_PRELOAD=libvma.so iperf -uc 224.22.22.22 -t 5



Configuration Values
====================

On default startup the VMA library logs to stderr the VMA version, the modified
configuration parameters being used and their values.
Please notice that except VMA_TRACELEVEL, VMA logs just those parameters whose value != default.

 VMA INFO: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------


VMA_TRACELEVEL 
Logging level the VMA library will be using. Default is info
Example: # VMA_TRACELEVEL=debug

none
    Print no log at all
panic
    Panic level logging, this would generally cause fatal behavior and an exception
    will be thrown by the VMA library. Typically, this is caused by memory 
    allocation problems. This level is rarely used.
error
    Runtime ERRORs in the VMA.
    Typically, these can provide insight for the developer of wrong internal
    logic like: Errors from underlaying OS or Infiniband verbs calls. internal
    double mapping/unmapping of objects.
warn
    Runtime warning that do not disrupt the workflow of the application but 
    might warn of a problem in the setup or the overall setup configuration. 
    Typically, these can be address resolution failure (due to wrong routing 
    setup configuration), corrupted ip packets in the receive path or 
    unsupported functions requested by the user application
info
    General information passed to the user of the application. Bring up 
    configuration logging or some general info to help the user better 
    use the VMA library
details
    Complete VMA's configuration information.
    Very high level insight of some of the critical decisions done in VMA.
debug
    High level insight to the operations done in the VMA. All socket API calls
    are logged and internal high level control channels log there activity.
fine
    Low level run time logging of activity. This logging level includes basic 
    Tx and Rx logging in the fast path and it will lower application 
    performance. It is recommended to use this level with VMA_LOG_FILE param.
finer
    Very low level run time logging of activity!
    This logging level will DRASTICALLY lower application performance.
    It is recommended to use this level with VMA_LOG_FILE param.
all
    today this level is identical to finer

VMA_LOG_DETAILS
Add details on each log line.
0 = Basic log line
1 = ThreadId
2 = ProcessId + ThreadId
3 = Time + ProcessId + ThreadId [Time is in milli-seconds from start of process]
Default value is 0

VMA_LOG_COLORS
Use color scheme when logging. Red for errors, purple for warnings and dim for
low level debugs. VMA_LOG_COLORS is automatically disabled when logging is direct 
to a non terminal device (e.g. VMA_LOG_FILE is configured).
Default value is 1 (Enabled)

VMA_LOG_FILE 
Redirect all VMA logging to a specific user defined file.
This is very useful when raising the VMA_TRACELEVEL
VMA will replace a single '%d' appearing in the log file name with the pid of
the process loaded with VMA. This can help in running multiple instances of VMA
each with it's own log file name.
Example:  VMA_LOG_FILE=/tmp/vma_log.txt

VMA_SPEC

Set the directory path for vma to create the shared memory files for vma_stats.
No files will be created when setting this value to empty string "". 
Default value is /tmp/

VMA_STATS_FD_NUM
Max number of sockets monitored by VMA statistic mechanism.
Value range is 0 to 1024.
Default value is 100

VMA_CONFIG_FILE
Sets the full path to the VMA configuration file.
Default values is: /etc/libvma.conf
Example: VMA_CONFIG_FILE=/tmp/libvma.conf

VMA_APPLICATION_ID
Specify a group of rules from libvma.conf for VMA to apply.
Example: 'VMA_APPLICATION_ID=iperf_server'.
Default is "VMA_DEFAULT_APPLICATION_ID" (match only the '*' group rule)

VMA_CPU_USAGE_STATS
Calculate VMA CPU usage during polling HW loops.
This information is available through VMA stats utility.
Default value is 0 (Disabled)

VMA_HANDLE_SIGINTR
When Enabled, VMA handler will be called when interrupt signal is sent to the process.
VMA will also call to application's handler if exist.
Value range is 0 to 1
Default value is 0 (Disabled)

VMA_HANDLE_SIGSEGV
When Enabled, print backtrace if segmentation fault happens.
Value range is 0 to 1
Default value is 0 (Disabled)

VMA_TX_SEGS_TCP
Number of TCP LWIP segments allocation for each VMA process.  
Default value is 1000000

VMA_TX_BUFS
Number of global Tx data buffer elements allocation.
Default value is 200000

VMA_TX_WRE
Number of Work Request Elements allocated in all transmit QP's.
The number of QP's can change according to the number of network offloaded
interfaces.
Default value is 3000

VMA_TX_WRE_BATCHING
The number of Tx Work Request Elements used until a completion signal is requested.
Tuning this parameter allows a better control of the jitter encountered from the 
Tx CQE handling. Setting a high batching value results in high PPS and lower 
avarge latency. Setting a low batching value results in lower latency std-dev.
Value range is 1-64
Default value is 64

VMA_TX_MAX_INLINE
Max send inline data set for QP. 
Data copied into the INLINE space is at least 32 bytes of headers and
the rest can be user datagram payload.
VMA_TX_MAX_INLINE=0 disables INLINEing on the tx transmit path.
In older releases this parameter was called: VMA_MAX_INLINE
Default VMA_TX_MAX_INLINE is 220

VMA_TX_MC_LOOPBACK
This parameter sets the initial value used by VMA internally to controls the
multicast loopback packets behavior during transmission.
An application that calls setsockopt() with IP_MULTICAST_LOOP will run over
the initial value set by this parameter.
Read more in 'Multicast loopback behavior' in notes section below
Default value is 1 (Enabled)

VMA_TX_NONBLOCKED_EAGAINS
Return value 'OK' on all send operation done on a non-blocked udp sockets. This
is the OS default behavior. The datagram sent is silently dropped inside VMA
or the network stack. 
When set Enabled (set to 1), VMA will return with error EAGAIN if it was unable
accomplish the send operation and the datagram was dropped.
In both cases a dropped Tx statistical counter is incremented.
Default value is 0 (Disabled)

VMA_TX_PREFETCH_BYTES
Accelerate offloaded send operation by optimizing cache. Different values 
give optimized send rate on different machines. We recommend you tune this
for your specific hardware.
Value range is 0 to MTU size
Disable with a value of 0
Default value is 256 bytes

VMA_RING_ALLOCATION_LOGIC_TX
VMA_RING_ALLOCATION_LOGIC_RX
Ring allocation logic is used to separate the traffic to different rings.
By default all sockets use the same ring for both RX and TX over the same interface.
Even when specifing the logic to be per socket or thread, for different interfaces 
we use different rings. This is useful when tuning for a multi-threaded application 
and aiming for HW resource separation.
Warning: This feature might hurt performance for applications which their main 
processing loop is based in select() and/or poll().
The logic options are:
0  - Ring per interface
10 - Ring per socket (using socket fd as separator)
20 - Ring per thread (using the id of the thread in which the socket was created)
30 - Ring per core (using cpu id)
31 - Ring per core - attach threads : attach each thread to a cpu core
Default value is 0

VMA_RING_MIGRATION_RATIO_TX
VMA_RING_MIGRATION_RATIO_RX
Ring migration ratio is used with the "ring per thread" logic in order to decide when
it is beneficial to replace the socket's ring with the ring allocated for the current thread.
Each VMA_RING_MIGRATION_RATIO iterations (of accessing the ring) we check the current 
thread ID and see if our ring is matching the current thread.
If not, we consider ring migration. If we keep accessing the ring from the same thread for some 
iterations, we migrate the socket to this thread ring.
Use a value of -1 in order to disable migration. 
Default value is 100

VMA_RING_LIMIT_PER_INTERFACE
Limit the number of rings that can be allocated per interface.
For example, in ring allocation per socket logic, if the number of sockets using 
the same interface is larger than the limit, then several sockets will be sharing the 
same ring.
[Note:VMA_RX_BUFS might need to be adjusted in order to have enough buffers for all
rings in the system. Each ring consume VMA_RX_WRE buffers.]
Use a value of 0 for unlimited number of rings.
Default value is 0 (no limit)

VMA_RX_BUFS
Number Rx data buffer elements allocation for the processes. These data buffers 
may be used by all QPs on all HCAs
Default value is 200000

VMA_RX_WRE
Number of Work Request Elements allocated in all receive QP's.
Default value is 16000

VMA_RX_WRE_BATCHING
Number of Work Request Elements and RX buffers to batch before recycling.
Batching decrease latency mean, but might increase latency STD.
Value range is 1-1024.
Default value is 64

VMA_RX_BYTES_MIN
Minimum value in bytes that will be used per socket by VMA when applications 
call to setsockopt(SO_RCVBUF). If application tries to set a smaller value then
configured in VMA_RX_BYTES_MIN, VMA will force this minimum limit value on the
socket.VMA offloaded socket's receive max limit of ready bytes count. If the
application does not drain a sockets and the byte limit is reached, new
received datagrams will be dropped.
Monitor of the applications socket's usage of current, max and dropped bytes
and packet counters can be done with vma_stats.
Default value is 2000000

VMA_RX_POLL
The number of times to poll on Rx path for ready packets before going to sleep
(wait for interrupt in blocked mode) or return -1 (in non-blocked mode).
This Rx polling is done when the application is working with direct blocked
calls to read(), recv(), recvfrom() & recvmsg().
When Rx path has successfull poll hits (see performace monitoring) the latency
is improved dramatically. This comes on account of CPU utilization.
Value range is -1, 0 to 100,000,000
Where value of -1 is used for infinite polling
Default value is 100000

VMA_RX_POLL_INIT
VMA maps all UDP sockets as potential offloaded capable. Only after the 
ADD_MEMBERSHIP does the offload start to work and the CQ polling kicks in VMA.
This parameter control the polling count during this transition phase where the
socket is a UDP unicast socket and no multicast addresses where added to it. 
Once the first ADD_MEMBERSHIP is called the above VMA_RX_POLL takes effect.
Value range is similar to the above VMA_RX_POLL
Default value is 0

VMA_RX_UDP_POLL_OS_RATIO
The above param will define the ratio between VMA CQ poll and OS FD poll.
This will result in a single poll of the not-offloaded sockets every
VMA_RX_UDP_POLL_OS_RATIO offloaded socket (CQ) polls. No matter if the CQ poll 
was a hit or miss. No matter if the socket is blocking or non-blocking.
When disabled, only offloaded sockets are polled.
This parameter replaces the two old parameters: VMA_RX_POLL_OS_RATIO and 
VMA_RX_SKIP_OS
Disable with 0
Default value is 100

VMA_HW_TS_CONVERSION
The above param defines the time stamp conversion method.
Experimental verbs is required for converting the time stamp from hardware time (Hz) 
to system time (seconds.nano_seconds). Hence, hardware support is not guaranteed.
The value of VMA_HW_TS_CONVERSION is determined by all devices - i.e if the hardware of
one device does not support the conversion, then it will be disabled for the other devices.
Currently only UDP RX flow is supported.
Options = [0,1,2,3,4]:
0 = Disabled
1 = Raw-HW time                           - only convert the time stamp to seconds.nano_seconds time
                                            units (or disable if hardware does not supports).
2 = Best possible - Raw-HW or system time - Sync to system time, then Raw hardware time -
                                            disable if none of them are supported by hardware. 
3 = Sync to system time                   - convert the time stamp to seconds.nano_seconds time units.
                                            comparable to UDP receive software timestamp.
                                            disable if hardware does not supports.
4 = PTP Sync                              - convert the time stamp to seconds.nano_seconds time units.
                                            in case it is not supported - will apply option 3 (or disable
                                            if hardware does not supports).
Default value: 3

VMA_RX_POLL_YIELD
When an application is running with multiple threads, on a limited number of
cores, there is a need for each thread polling inside the VMA (read, readv, 
recv & recvfrom) to yield the CPU to other polling thread so not to starve 
them from processing incoming packets.
Default value is 0 (Disable)

VMA_RX_PREFETCH_BYTES
Size of receive buffer to prefetch into cache while processing ingress packets.
The default is a single cache line of 64 bytes which should be at least 32 
bytes to cover the IPoIB+IP+UDP headers and a small part of the users payload.
Increasing this can help improve performance for larger user payload sizes.
Value range is 32 bytes to MTU size
Default value is 256 bytes

VMA_RX_PREFETCH_BYTES_BEFORE_POLL
Same as the above VMA_RX_PREFETCH_BYTES, only that prefetch is done before 
acutally getting the packets.
This benefit low pps traffic latency.
Disable with 0.
Default value is 0

VMA_RX_CQ_DRAIN_RATE_NSEC
Socket's receive path CQ drain logic rate control. 
When disabled (Default) the socket's receive path will first try to return a
ready packet from the socket's receive ready packet queue. Only if that queue
is empty will the socket check the CQ for ready completions for processing.
When enabled, even if the socket's receive ready packet queue is not empty it
will still check the CQ for ready completions for processing. This CQ polling
rate is controls in nano-second resolution to prevent CPU consumption because
of over CQ polling. This will enable a more 'real time' monitoring of the 
sockets ready packet queue.
Recommended value is 100-5000 (nsec)
Default value is 0 (Disable)

VMA_RX_POLL_ON_TX_TCP
This parameter enables/disables TCP RX polling during TCP TX operation for faster 
TCP ACK reception. 
Default: 0 (Disable)

VMA_GRO_STREAMS_MAX
Control the number of TCP streams to perform GRO (generic receive offload) simultaneously.
Disable GRO with a value of 0.
Default value is 32

VMA_TCP_3T_RULES
Use only 3 tuple rules for TCP, instead of using 5 tuple rules.
This can improve performance for a server with listen socket which accept many
connections.

VMA_ETH_MC_L2_ONLY_RULES
Use only L2 rules for Ethernet Multicast.
All loopback traffic will be handled by VMA instead of OS.

VMA_MC_FORCE_FLOWTAG
Forces the use of flow tag acceleration for multicast flows where setsockopt(SO_REUSEADDR) is
set.
Applicable if there are no other sockets opened for the same flow in system.

VMA_SELECT_POLL
The duration in micro-seconds (usec) in which to poll the hardware on Rx path before
going to sleep (pending an interrupt blocking on OS select(), poll() or epoll_wait().
The max polling duration will be limited by the timeout the user is using when 
calling select(), poll() or epoll_wait().
When select(), poll() or epoll_wait() path has successfull receive poll hits
(see performace monitoring) the latency is improved dramatically. This comes 
on account of CPU utilization.
Value range is -1, 0 to 100,000,000
Where value of -1 is used for infinite polling
Where value of 0 is used for no polling (interrupt driven)
Default value is 100000

VMA_SELECT_POLL_OS_FORCE
This flag forces to poll the OS file descriptors while user thread calls
select(), poll() or epoll_wait() even when no offloaded sockets are mapped.
Enabling this flag causes VMA to set VMA_SELECT_POLL_OS_RATIO and
VMA_SELECT_SKIP_OS to 1. This will result in VMA_SELECT_POLL number of
times VMA will poll the OS file descriptors, along side with offloaded
sockets, if such sockets exists.
Note that setting VMA_SELECT_SKIP_OS and VMA_SELECT_POLL_OS_RATIO
directly will override the values these parameters gets while
VMA_SELECT_POLL_OS_FORCE is enabled.
Enable with 1
Disable with 0
Default value is 0

VMA_SELECT_POLL_OS_RATIO
This will enable polling of the OS file descriptors while user thread calls
select(), poll() or epoll_wait() and the VMA is busy in the offloaded sockets
polling loop. This will result in a signle poll of the not-offloaded sockets
every VMA_SELECT_POLL_RATIO offlaoded sockets (CQ) polls.
When disabled, only offlaoded sockets are polled. 
(See VMA_SELECT_POLL for more info)
Disable with 0
Default value is 10

VMA_SELECT_SKIP_OS
Similar to VMA_RX_SKIP_OS, but in select(), poll() or epoll_wait() this will
force the VMA to check the non offloaded fd even though an offloaded socket
has ready packets found while polling.
Default value is 4

VMA_PROGRESS_ENGINE_INTERVAL
VMA Internal thread safe check that the CQ is drained at least onse
every N milliseconds. 
This mechanism allows VMA to progress the TCP stack even when the application 
doesn't access its socket (so it doesn't provide a context to VMA).
If CQ was already drained by the application receive
socket API calls then this thread goes back to sleep without any processing.
Disable with 0
Default value is 10 msec

VMA_PROGRESS_ENGINE_WCE_MAX
Each time VMA's internal thread starts it's CQ draining, it will stop when 
reach this max value. 
The application is not limited by this value in the number of CQ elements
it can ProcessId form calling any of the receive path socket APIs.
Default value is 10000

VMA_CQ_MODERATION_ENABLE

Maximum period value to use in the adaptive interrupt moderation algorithm.
Default value is 250

VMA_CQ_AIM_INTERVAL_MSEC
Frequency of interrupt moderation adaptation.
Intervall in milli-seconds between adaptation attempts.
Use value of 0 to disable adaptive interrupt moderation.
Default value is 250

VMA_CQ_AIM_INTERRUPTS_RATE_PER_SEC

The count and period parameters for CQ moderation will change automatically
to achieve the desired interrupt rate for the current traffic rate.
Default value is 5000

VMA_CQ_POLL_BATCH_MAX
Max size of the array while polling the CQs in the VMA
Default value is 16

VMA_CQ_KEEP_QP_FULL
If disabled (default), CQ will not try to compensate for each poll on the
receive path. It will use a "debth" to remember how many WRE miss from each QP
to fill it when buffers become avilable.
If enabled, CQ will try to compensate QP for each polled receive completion. If
buffers are short it will re-post a recently completed buffer. This causes a packet
drop and will be monitored in the vma_stats.
Default value is 1 (Enabled)

VMA_QP_COMPENSATION_LEVEL
Number of spare receive buffer CQ holds to allow for filling up QP while full 
receive buffers are being processes inside VMA. 
Default value is 256 buffers

VMA_OFFLOADED_SOCKETS
Create all sockets as offloaded/not-offloaded by default.
Value of 1 is for offloaded, 0 for not-offloaded.
Default value is 1 (Enabled)

VMA_TIMER_RESOLUTION_MSEC
Control VMA internal thread wakeup timer resolution (in milli seconds)
Default value is 10 (milli-sec)

VMA_TCP_TIMER_RESOLUTION_MSEC

Minimum value is the internal thread wakeup timer resolution (VMA_TIMER_RESOLUTION_MSEC).
Default value is 100 (milli-sec)

VMA_TCP_CTL_THREAD
Do all tcp control flows in the internal thread.
This feature should be kept disabled if using blocking poll/select (epoll is OK).
Use value of 0 to disable.
Use value of 1 for waking up the thread when there is work to do.
Use value of 2 for waiting for thread timer to expire.
Default value is disabled

VMA_TCP_TIMESTAMP_OPTION
If set, enable TCP timestamp option.
Currently, LWIP is not supporting RTTM and PAWS mechanisms. 
See RFC1323 for info.
Use value of 0 to disable.
Use value of 1 for enable.
Use value of 2 for OS follow up.
Disabled by default (enabling causing a slight performance degradation).

VMA_TCP_NODELAY
If set, disable the Nagle algorithm option for each TCP socket during initialization.
This means that TCP segments are always sent as soon as possible, even if there is
only a small amount of data.
For more information on TCP_NODELAY flag refer to tcp manual page.
Valid Values are:
Use value of 0 to disable.
Use value of 1 for enable.
Default value is Disabled.

VMA_RX_SW_CSUM
This parameter enables/disables software checksum validation for ingress TCP/UDP IP packets.
Most Mellanox HCAs support hardware offload checksum validation. If the hardware does not
support checksum validation offload, software checksum validation is required.
When this parameter is enabled, software checksum validation is calculated only if hardware
offload checksum validation is not performed.
Performance degradation might occur if hardware offload fails to validate checksum and
software calculation is used.
Note that disabling software calculation might cause corrupt packets to be
processed by VMA and the application, when the hardware does not perform this action.
For further details on which adapter card supports hardware offload checksum validation,
please refer to the VMA Release Notes.
Valid Values are:
Use value of 0 to disable.
Use value of 1 for enable.
Default value is Enabled.

VMA_EXCEPTION_HANDLING
Mode for handling missing support or error cases in Socket API or functionality by VMA.
Useful for quickly identifying VMA unsupported Socket API or features
Use value of -1 for just handling at DEBUG severity.
Use value of 0 to log DEBUG message and try recovering via Kernel network stack (un-offloading the socket).
Use value of 1 to log ERROR message and try recovering via Kernel network stack (un-offloading the socket).
Use value of 2 to log ERROR message and return API respectful error code.
Use value of 3 to log ERROR message and abort application (throw vma_error exception).
Default value is -1 (notice, that in the future the default value will be changed to 0)

VMA_AVOID_SYS_CALLS_ON_TCP_FD
For TCP fd, avoid system calls for the supported options of:
ioctl, fcntl, getsockopt, setsockopt.
Non-supported options will go to OS.
To activate, use VMA_AVOID_SYS_CALLS_ON_TCP_FD=1.
Default value is disabled

VMA_INTERNAL_THREAD_AFFINITY
Control which CPU core(s) the VMA internal thread is serviced on. The cpu set
should be provided as *EITHER* a hexidecmal value that represents a bitmask. *OR* as a 
comma delimited of values (ranges are ok). Both the bitmask and comma delimited list
methods are identical to what is supported by the taskset command. See the man page
on taskset for additional information.
Where value of -1 disables internal thread affinity setting by VMA
Bitmask Examples:
0x00000001 - Run on processor 0.
0x00000007 - Run on processors 1,2, and 3.
Comma Delimited Examples:
0,4,8      - Run on processors 0,4, and 8.
0,1,7-10   - Run on processors 0,1,7,8,9 and 10.
Default value is -1 (Disabled).

VMA_INTERNAL_THREAD_CPUSET
Select a cpuset for VMA internal thread (see man page of cpuset).
The value is the path to the cpuset (for example: /dev/cpuset/my_set), or an empty
string to run it on the same cpuset the process runs on.
Default value is an empty string. 

VMA_INTERNAL_THREAD_TCP_TIMER_HANDLING
Select the internal thread policy when handling TCP timers 
Use value of 0 for deferred handling. The internal thread will not handle TCP timers upon timer 
expiration (once every 100ms) in order to let application threads handling it first
Use value of 1 for immediate handling. The internal thread will try locking and handling TCP timers upon 
timer expiration (once every 100ms).  Application threads may be blocked till internal thread finishes handling TCP timers
Default value is 0 (deferred handling)

VMA_INTERNAL_THREAD_ARM_CQ
Wakeup the internal thread for each packet that the CQ recieve. 
Poll and process the packet and bring it to the socket layer.
This can minimize latency in case of a busy application which is not available to 
recieve the packet when it arrived.
However, this might decrease performance in case of high pps rate application.   
Default value is 0 (Disabled)

VMA_WAIT_AFTER_JOIN_MSEC
This parameter indicates the time of delay the first packet send after
receiving the multicast JOINED event from the SM
This is helpful to over come loss of first few packets of an outgoing stream
due to SM lengthy handling of MFT configuration on the switch chips
Default value is 0 (milli-sec)

VMA_THREAD_MODE
By default VMA is ready for multi-threaded applications, meaning it is thread safe.
If the users application is a single threaded one, then using this configuration
parameter you can help eliminate VMA locks and get even better performance.
Single threaded application value is 0
Multi threaded application using spin lock value is 1
Multi threaded application using mutex lock value is 2 
Multi threaded application with more threads than cores using spin lock value is 3
Default value is 1 (Multi with spin lock)

VMA_BUFFER_BATCHING_MODE
Batching of returning Rx buffers and pulling Tx buffers per socket.
In case the value is 0 then VMA will not use buffer batching.
In case the value is 1 then VMA will use buffer batching and will try to periodically reclaim unused buffers.
In case the value is 2 then VMA will use buffer batching with no reclaim.
[future: other values are reserved]
Default value is 1

VMA_MEM_ALLOC_TYPE
This replaces the VMA_HUGETBL parameter logic.
VMA will try to allocate data buffers as configured:
	0 - "ANON" - using malloc
	1 - "CONTIG" - using contiguous pages
	2 - "HUGEPAGES" - using huge pages.
OFED will also try to allocate QP & CQ memory accordingly:
	0 - "ANON" - default - use current pages ANON small ones.
	"HUGE" - force huge pages
	"CONTIG" - force contig pages
	1 - "PREFER_CONTIG" - try contig fallback to ANON small pages.
	"PREFER_HUGE" - try huge fallback to ANON small pages.
	2 - "ALL" - try huge fallback to contig if failed fallback to ANON small pages.
To overrive OFED use: (MLX_QP_ALLOC_TYPE, MLX_CQ_ALLOC_TYPE)
Default value is 1 (Contiguous pages)

The following VMA neigh parameters are for advanced users or Mellanox support only: 

VMA_NEIGH_UC_ARP_QUATA
VMA will send UC ARP in case neigh state is NUD_STALE.
In case that neigh state is still NUD_STALE VMA will try 
VMA_NEIGH_UC_ARP_QUATA retries to send UC ARP again and then will send BC ARP.  

VMA_NEIGH_UC_ARP_DELAY_MSEC
This parameter indicates number of msec to wait betwen every UC ARP.

VMA_NEIGH_NUM_ERR_RETRIES
This number inidcates number of retries to restart neigh state machine in case neigh got ERROR event.
Deafult value is 1

VMA_BF
This flag enables / disables BF (Blue Flame) usage of the ConnectX
Deafult value is 1 (Enabled)

VMA_FORK
Control whether VMA should support fork. Setting this flag on will cause VMA to
call ibv_fork_init() function. ibv_fork_init() initializes libibverbs's data
structures to handle fork() function calls correctly and avoid data corruption.
If ibv_fork_init() is not called or returns a non-zero status, then libibverbs 
data structures are not fork()-safe and the effect of an application calling
fork() is undefined.
ibv_fork_init() works on Linux kernels 2.6.17 and higher which support the
MADV_DONTFORK flag for madvise().
Note that VMA's default with huge pages enabled (VMA_HUGETBL) you should use an
OFED stack version that support fork()ing of with huge pages (OFED 1.5 and higher).
Default value is 0 (Disabled)

VMA_CLOSE_ON_DUP2
When this parameter is enabled, VMA will handle the dupped fd (oldfd),
as if it was closed (clear internal data structures) and only then,
will forward the call to the OS.
This is, in practice, a very rudimentary dup2 support.
It only supports the case, where dup2 is used to close file descriptors,
Default value is 1 (Enabled)

VMA_MTU
Size of each Rx and Tx data buffer (Maximum Transfer Unit).
This value sets the fragmentation size of the packets sent by the VMA library.
If VMA_MTU is 0 then for each inteterface VMA will follow the actual MTU.
If VMA_MTU is greater than 0 then this MTU value is applicable to all interfaces regardless of their actual MTU
Default value is 0 (following interface actual MTU)

VMA_MSS
VMA_MSS define the max TCP payload size that can sent without IP fragmentation.
Value of 0 will set VMA's TCP MSS to be aligned with VMA_MTU configuration 
(leaving 40 bytes room for IP + TCP headers; "TCP MSS = VMA_MTU - 40").
Other VMA_MSS values will force VMA's TCP MSS to that specific value.
Default value is 0 (following VMA_MTU)

VMA_TCP_CC_ALGO
TCP congestion control algorithm.
The default algorithm coming with LWIP is a variation of Reno/New-Reno.
The new Cubic algorithm was adapted from FreeBsd implementation.
Use value of 0 for LWIP algorithm.
Use value of 1 for the Cubic algorithm.
Default value is 0 (LWIP).

VMA_TCP_MAX_SYN_RATE
Limit the number of TCP SYN packets that VMA will handle
per second per listen socket.
For example, in case you use 10 for this value than VMA will accept at most 10
(could be less) new connections per second per listen socket.
Use a value of 0 for un-limiting the number of TCP SYN packets that can be handled.
Value range is 0 to 100000.
Default value is 0 (no limit)


VMA Monitoring & Performance Counters
=====================================
The VMA internal performance counters include information per user
sockets and a global view on select() and epoll_wait() usage by the application.

Use the 'vma_stats' included utility to view the per socket information and
performance counters during run time.
Usage:
        vma_stats [-p pid] [-k directory] [-v view] [-d details] [-i interval]

Defaults:
        find_pid=enabled, directory="/tmp/", view=1, details=1, interval=1,

Options:
  -p, --pid=<pid>               Show VMA statistics for proccess with pid: <pid>

Use VMA_STATS_FILE to get internal VMA statistics like vma_stats provide.
If this parameter is set and the user application performed transmite or receive
activity on a socket, then these values will be logs once the sockets are closed.

Below is a logout example of a socket performance counters.
Below the logout example there is some explanations about the numbers.

VMA: [fd=10] Tx Offload: 455 KB / 233020 / 0 / 3 [bytes/packets/drops/errors]
VMA: [fd=10] Tx OS info:   0 KB /      0 / 0 [bytes/packets/errors]
VMA: [fd=10] Rx Offload: 455 KB / 233020 / 0 / 0 [bytes/packets/eagains/errors]
VMA: [fd=10] Rx byte: max 200 / dropped 0 (0.00%) / limit 2000000
VMA: [fd=10] Rx pkt : max 1 / dropped 0 (0.00%)
VMA: [fd=10] Rx OS info:   0 KB /      0 / 0 [bytes/packets/errors]
VMA: [fd=10] Rx poll: 0 / 233020 (100.00%) [miss/hit]

Looking good :)
- No errors on transmite or receive on this socket (user fd=10)
- All the traffic was offloaded. No packets transmitted or receive via the OS. 
- Just about no missed Rx polls (see VMA_RX_POLL & VMA_SELECT_POLL), meaning
 the receiving thread did not get to a blocked state to cause a contexts
 switch and hurt latency.
- No dropped packets caused by socket receive buffer limit (see VMA_RX_BYTES_MIN)

Interrupt Moderation
====================
The basic idea behind interrupt moderation is that the HW will not generate
interrupt for each packet, but instead only after some amount of packets received 
or after the packet was held for some time.

The adaptive interrupt moderation change this packet count and time period
automatically to reach a desired rate of interrupts.


1. Use VMA_RX_POLL=0 and VMA_SELECT_POLL=0 to work in interrupt driven mode.

2. Control the period and frame count parameters with:
    VMA_CQ_MODERATION_COUNT - hold #count frames before interrupt
    VMA_CQ_MODERATION_PERIOD_USEC - hold #usec before interrupt

3. Control the adaptive algorithm with the following:
    VMA_CQ_AIM_MAX_COUNT - max possible #count frames to hold
    VMA_CQ_AIM_MAX_PERIOD_USEC - max possible #usec to hold
    VMA_CQ_AIM_INTERRUPTS_RATE_PER_SEC - desired interrupt rate
    VMA_CQ_AIM_INTERVAL_MSEC - frequency of adaptation

4. Disable CQ moderation with VMA_CQ_MODERATION_ENABLE=0
5. Disable Adaptive CQ moderation with VMA_CQ_AIM_INTERVAL_MSEC=0




Notes
=====
* Multicast loopback behavior: 
	There is a different behavior between IPoIB and VMA when dealing with 
	multicast packets at the same machine:
	- When sending from VMA application to ipoib application on the same
	machine the packet will never be accepted by the ipoib side (even when 
	the loopback is enabled)
	- When sending from ipoib application to VMA application on the same 
	machine, the packet will always be accepted by the VMA side (even when 
	the loop is disabled

  VMA WARNING: ***************************************************************
This warning message means that you are using VMA with hugepages memory allocation,
but not enough huge pages resources are available in the system.
If you want VMA to take full advantage of the performance benefits of huge pages then
you should restart the application after adding more hugepages resources in your
system similar to the details in the warning message above or trying to free unused hupge
pages shared memory segments with the below script.

NOTE: Use 'ipcs -m' and 'ipcrm -m shmid' to check and clean unused shared memory segments.
Below is a short script to help you release VMAs unused huge pages resources:
    for shmid in `ipcs -m | grep 0x00000000 | awk '{print $2}'`; 
    do echo 'Clearing' $shmid; ipcrm -m $shmid; 
    done;


* Not supported Bonding Configuration:

 VMA WARNING: ******************************************************************************
 VMA WARNING: VMA doesn't support current bonding configuration of bond0.
 VMA WARNING: The only supported bonding mode is "802.3ad(#4)" or "active-backup(#1)"
 VMA WARNING: with "fail_over_mac=1" or "fail_over_mac=0".
 VMA WARNING: The effect of working in unsupported bonding mode is undefined.
 VMA WARNING: Read more about Bonding in the VMA's User Manual  
 VMA WARNING: ******************************************************************************

This warning message means that VMA has detected bonding device which is configured 
to work in mode which is not supported by VMA, this means that VMA will not support 
high avilability events for that interface. 
VMA currently supports just active-backup(#1) or 802.3ad(#4) and fail_over_mac = 1 or 0 mode.
In order to fix this issue please change the bonding configuration.

Example:

Lets assume that the bonding device is bond0, which has two slaves: ib0 and
ib1.

Shut down the bond0 interface:
#ifconfig bond0 down

Find all the slaves of bond0:
#cat sys/class/net/bond0/bonding/slaves
ib0 ib1 

Free all the slaves:
#echo -ib0 > /sys/class/net/bond0/bonding/slaves
#echo -ib1 > /sys/class/net/bond0/bonding/slaves

Change the bond mode:
#echo active-backup > /sys/class/net/bond0/bonding/mode

Change the fail_over_mac mode:
#echo 1 > /sys/class/net/bond0/bonding/fail_over_mac

Enslave the interfaces back:
#echo +ib0 > /sys/class/net/bond0/bonding/slaves
#echo +ib1 > /sys/class/net/bond0/bonding/slaves

Bring up the bonding interface:
#ifconfig bond0 up
OR
#ifconfig bond0 <ip> netmask <netmask> up

* Not supported Bonding & VLAN Configuration:

 VMA WARNING: ******************************************************************
 VMA WARNING: bond0.10: vlan over bond while fail_over_mac=1 is not offloaded
 VMA WARNING: ******************************************************************

This warning message means that VMA has detected bonding device which is configured with 
VLAN over it while fail_over_mac=1.
This means that the bond will not be offloaded.
In order to fix this issue please change the bonding configuration.
