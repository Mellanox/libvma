VMA Testing Environment
=======================

This set of tests is based on Google Test C++ environment 
https://github.com/google/googletest

Testing VMA Extended API
------------------------
1. Enable VMA_EXTRA_API_ENABLED in tests/gtest/vma/vma_base.cc
2. Configure libvma with --enable-socketxtreme option and build it
3. Compile the gtests by issuing from VMA root directory:
   make -C tests/gtest
4. Launch tests by issuing:
   LD_PRELOAD=path_to_your_libvma.so tests/gtest/gtest --addr=client_ip:server_ip

Testing Environment
-------------------
The VMA Extended API gtest environment requires that there be two interfaces
connected back to back or via a switch. One is the server and the other is the
client.
