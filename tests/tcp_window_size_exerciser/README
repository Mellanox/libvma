Short description:
		This is a client server test that built to exercise the tcp window size.

Supported OSes:
		Linux

Description:
		This is a client server test that built to exercise the TCP window size changing during traffic.
		- TCP window size changed due to the use of setsockopt function with SO_RCVBUF parameter.

How to use:
	1. Compile the code using the Make file or running next commands from Shell command line:
		Client -> $ gcc -lrt tcp_hang_test_client.c -o client
		Server -> $ gcc -lrt tcp_hang_test_server.c -o server

	2. Run server side - don't forget to update all relevant parameters like IP and port
		$ ./server -i 9.9.9.4 -p 5000 -s 1000000 -t 10 -m 500 -M 30000 -c 122

		-i: Server IP
		-p: Server port
		-s: Sleep time interval [msec]
		-t: Update receive window size every # seconds
		-m: Minimal receive window size [bytes]
		-M: Maximum receive window size [bytes]
		-c: Client message size
		Example:  ./server -i 9.9.9.4 -p 5000 -s 1000000 -t 10 -m 500 -M 30000 -c 122

	4. Run client side - don't forget to update LD_PRELOAD path and all other parameters like IP and port
		$ LD_PRELOAD=libvma.so ./client.o -i 9.9.9.3 -s 9.9.9.4 -p 5000 -m 122

		-i: Client IP
		-s: Server IP
		-p: Server port
		-m: Client -> Server message size [bytes](1000> X >=4)
		Example: ./client -i 9.9.9.3 -s 9.9.9.4 -p 5000 -m 122

Known issues:
		The hang may appear after 10-15 seconds if VMA version is lower than 8.1.4.

To do:
		None
